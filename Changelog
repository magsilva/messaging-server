- Fixed fifo_put()
- Added crc32 functions (crc32.c, crc32.h)
- Created crc32test
- Added crc16 function (crc16.c, crc16.h)

- Removed some garbage from fifoTest.c
- Improved balance threads criteria (max and min threads)
- Some minor optimizations at setWorker and Receiver threads
- Wrote some source code documentation

- Fixed the segmentation fault (I was using a mutex pointer instead of mutex at
struct fifo_t, just changed it and everything started working).
